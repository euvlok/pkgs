//! Library entry point for `claude-statusline`.
//!
//! The crate is primarily a binary (`src/main.rs`), but exposing the
//! modules through a `lib.rs` lets external benches in `benches/` reach
//! into the rendering, parsing, and pricing internals without having to
//! shell out to the binary. The public API is intentionally not stable —
//! anything here is `pub` for the benches and tests, not for downstream
//! consumers.
